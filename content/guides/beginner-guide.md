# Overview

First off, Shiren 4 Plus is a traditional roguelike game.

- Tile-based movement and turn-based combat.
- Player level and stats reset between each adventure.
- You'll lose all items and money if you collapse.

That sounds a bit intimidating, but the game also features support systems.

- Allies who keep their level ups between each adventure.
- Equipment tags so that you can reclaim lost weapons or shields.
- Storehouse and bank to keep important items and money safe.
- Side content to play as practice if the main story is too hard at first.

It can feel luck-based and unfair at first, but that's because you lack knowledge and experience.<br/>The game pushes you in the direction of growing as a player, rather than grinding until you win like a JRPG.<br/>If you stick with it, you'll find that it's a very rewarding gameplay experience.

<div class="dungeonPageImage2">
  <img src="../images/dungeons/grasslands.png" alt="Grasslands"/> <img src="../images/dungeons/gonchiki_village.png" alt="Gonchiki Village"/>
</div>

Details about [Emerald Terrace](/dungeons/emerald-terrace) can be found on its dungeon page.<br/>For now, the focus will be getting used to how the game plays.

#### Basics

- The player and monsters take turns. Turn ending actions include:
    - Attacking
    - Moving
    - Using an item
    - Talking to a NPC
    - Stepping in place
- HP regenrates only when you move or step in place.
    - Step in place: Press X + O at the same time.
- The player gets hungry as he performs actions, depleting fullness.
    - Fullness decreases by 1 every 10 turns.
    - Once fullness reaches 0, you'll take 1 damage per turn.
    - Fullness can be replenished by eating banana, onigiri, or grass items.
    - Bananas ripen as you advance floors, and ripe bananas replenish more fullness.
- 1 Diagonal movement is equal to 2 orthogonal movements.
    - Hold R to guarantee diagonal movement.
    - Diagonal movement is key to conserving fullness and fleeing from enemies.
- Hold X and move to perform a fast dash.
    - Turns pass like normal while dashing, so it can be risky if there are strong enemies around.
    - You can also hold X and move toward an item to step on it without picking it up.
- Sort items in your inventory by pressing the Square button.
    - Gitan (money) and projectiles will become stacked if applicable.
- Rocks and arrows can be equipped from the item menu.
    - This lets you use the item by pressing L instead of having to open the menu.
- Insert bananas into Storage Pots to keep them safe from spoiling.
    - Bananas ripen as you advance floors. (Green Banana → Yellow Banana → Ripe Banana → Spoiled Banana)
- Equip weapons to raise attack power, and shields to raise defense.
    - Shiren's defense doesn't increase from leveling up.
- Weapons and shields gain skill points when you defeat monsters using direct attacks.
    - Once the bar is full, the piece of equipment will level up and become stronger.
        - Attack or defense might increases.
        - Upgrade limit increases.
        - Rune slots might increase.

#### Combat

- Lure enemies toward you by performing a direct attack instead of stepping toward them.
    - This avoids letting enemies get the first hit.
    - Some enemies have long-ranged attacks, so you'll want to zigzag against those.
- If there are multiple enemies in the room, retreat into a hallway and fight them 1 vs 1.
- If your HP is getting low, go ahead and retreat for a bit before continuing the fight.
    - If you're sandwiched by 2 enemies, consider using an item.
- Don't hesitate to use items. You'll lose all items if you collapse, so don't be stingy.
    - Herb, Otogiriso, and Heal Grass can be used when your HP is full to increase max HP.
    - Weapons and shields you don't need can be thrown to deal damage from a distance.
    - Gitan bags can be thrown to deal (Gitan value / 10) points of damage.
    - Staves can be thrown to get one last use out of them even when remaining uses is 0.
- If you're one hit away from collapsing, you need to use an item.
    - Gambling on a direct attack or projectile is a sure way to end up collapsed.
        - The player's direct attacks have 92\~95% accuracy, based on weapon level.
        - Projectiles have 84% accuracy.
- If there's a tough enemy coming your way, soften it with projectiles.
    - Deal enough damage so that one direct attack finishes it off.
    - However, if your HP is full, consider fighting it normally to conserve items.

#### Other

- If you linger on a floor for a very long time, Winds of Kron will begin to blow.
    - If you get blown away by the wind, you'll lose all items and money, as if you collapsed.
    - The wind gusts 3 times as warnings before finally blowing the player away.
- Traps can be hidden in the ground, and trigger when you step onto the tile.
    - Trip Stones can cause pots to break, so it's good to carry a Balance Staff if you find one.
- Wandering NPCs can be found at times, and offer items or services to help you out.
    - See [NPCs](/system/npcs) for details.
- Items can be blessed, cursed, or sealed.
    - Blessed items have stronger effects.
    - Cursed equipment can't be unequipped.
    - Sealed items can't be used.
    - Curses and seals can be removed using items like Purify Scroll, Purify Pot, etc.
    - Curses and seals can also be removed by Purifier NPCs in villages or dungeons.

#### Gonchiki Village

See [Villages](/system/villages) for details about available facilities.

- [Equipment tags](/system/gameplay-basics#equipment-tags) can now be placed on weapons or shields at shops for 3,000 Gitan each.
    - If you lose a tagged item, it'll be delivered to the Watchman's Lodge in Gonchiki Village.
        - Basically a way to ensure you don't permanently lose your main weapon or shield.
        - You'll occasionally need to pay some Gitan to pick the item up.
    - However, there are some cases where a tagged item won't be delivered.
        - Item was turned into a banana or Weeds due to a monster's special attack.
        - Item was inserted into a Presto or Sale pot.
        - Quit the game without suspending properly / game froze.

  <img src="../images/dungeons/ruins_of_laferriere.png" alt="Southern Isle Beach"/>
</div>

#### Basics

- Ominous Auras can occur inside the ruins if you linger a long time on a floor.
    - Once the Ominous Aura occurs, an extremely strong monster called Villeater can begin to spawn.
    - Trying to fight Villeaters will likely end your run, so don't spend too much time on each floor.

    - Kappa Pest throws items on the ground at you.<br/>...And so on.
- Power type monsters appear.

#### Synthesis

<div class="relativeImage monsterImage">
  <img src="../images/monsters/mixer.png" alt="Mixer"/>
</div>

- A monster called [Mixer](/system/monsters#mixer) appears, and can be used to synthesize items.
    - This is an extremely important mechanic to understand and utilize.
    - Basically, throw 2 items at it to combine items, and then defeat it to collect the result.
        - See [Synthesis](/system/gameplay-basics#synthesis) for details, and [Runes](/system/synthesis-runes) for a list of equipment abilities and recipes.
    - Mixer spawns between 26\~27F in Emerald Terrace.

#### Progressing

At this point, you should have a decent grasp of gameplay mechanics.<br/>

# Explanations

This section offers either text or links to other pages that explain gameplay mechanics.

### Basics

#### Suspending (Saving)

When you want to quit the game, select the Suspend command from the menu,<br/>
then return to the top menu before closing the game.

If you close the game without suspending, you'll lose all items and money as if you collapsed,<br/>
and will resume the game from Boronga Village.

#### Turns

If you move, attack, use an item, talk to a NPC, or step in place, monsters will then take a step or attack.<br/>As long as you don't act, nothing else will, so stay calm and think things through.

#### Map

Rooms and hallways you've traversed on the current floor will be recorded on the map.

|Dot|Info|
|-|-|
|White|The player|
|Red|Monsters|
|Blue|Items on the ground|
|Yellow|Allies, NPCs|

#### Terrain

Normally, water, air, and wall tiles are not traversable.<br/>
However, some monsters can walk on water, float in midair, or move inside walls.

#### Fullness

As turns pass, your fullness will deplete at the rate of 1 per 10 turns.<br/>
When your fullness reaches 0, your HP will start to decrease by 1 each turn.<br/>
Eat banana, onigiri, or grass items to replenish fullness.

#### Collapsing

If your HP goes to 0, you'll collapse.<br/>
If you collapse, you'll lose all items and money, and will return to Boronga Village.<br/>
So if you're in a tough spot, don't be stingy - use your items!

#### Winds of Kron

If you spend too many turns on the same floor, Winds of Kron will blow.<br/>
When the 4th gust blows, you'll be blown out of the dungeon as if you had collapsed.<br/>
Revival Grass and Undo Grass can't save you from the gust, so hurry to the next floor.

#### Abilities

As you continue your adventures, you'll reach a point where you can learn abilities.<br/>
Abilities are effective for dealing damage to night monsters, but they can't be used during the day.

See [Abilities](/system/necklace-abilities) for details.

#### Night

Some dungeons or floor ranges have a day and night cycle, which alternates based on elapsed turns.

- Field of view is reduced to a 1 tile radius, but can be expanded by equipping a torch.
    - Night monsters deal more damage to you if you don't have a torch equipped.
- Daytime monsters are replaced by night monsters.
    - Night monsters only take 1 damage from attacks other than abilities.
        - Up to 8 abilities can be assigned, and each ability can only be used 1 time per floor.
        - You can refresh abilities by reading a Replenish Scroll.

See [Day / Night](/system/gameplay-basics#day-/-night) for details.

#### Speed and Status

Normally, it takes 1 turn to perform 1 action, but traps and items can change that formula.

- Slow: Act once every 2 turns.
- Swift: Act 2 times per turn.

Monsters can also have varying action speed.

- Slow: Act once every 2 turns.
- Swift 1: Act 2 times per turn, but attacking once ends its turn.
- Swift 2: Act 2 times per turn, and can attack twice.

Traps and items can give you or monsters a variety of status conditions.<br/>
For example, if you throw Sleep Grass at a monster, it will be afflicted with Asleep status.

See [Status Conditions](/system/status-conditions) for details.

### Item Related

#### Sorting

The player can hold up to 24 items, which can be sorted by pressing Square in the inventory menu.<br/>Keep your inventory organized so you can readily assess the strategic options you have available.

#### Pot and Staff Numbers

Staves and pots have a number showing how many uses they have left.

The number on staves represent how many more times they can be swung.<br/>
A staff can be thrown to get one last use out of it once its remaining uses reaches 0.

The number on a pot represents how many more items you can insert into it.<br/>
Some pots are opened instead, and the number represents how many more times it can be opened.

#### Bananas and Storage Pots

Bananas are important items that replenish your fullness.<br/>
That said, if you step on a Spoil Trap, all bananas in your inventory will become spoiled.<br/>
If you have a Storage Pot, insert bananas into it to protect them from that trap.

#### Storehouse & Warehouse

Some villages have storage that can house your items.<br/>
Items kept inside a storehouse or warehouse won't be lost if you collapse in a dungeon.

#### Equipment

Weapons increase the damage you deal to monsters, and shields reduce damage inflicted by monsters.<br/>Both have to be equipped using the Equip command to receive their effects.

#### Upgrading Equipment

Weapons and shields can be upgraded by certain scrolls or by blacksmiths.<br/>
A number representing upgrade value such as "+1" is displayed if an item has been upgraded.

#### Leveling Up Equipment

Weapons and shields that are equipped gain skill points as you defeat monsters with direct attacks.<br/>Once the bar is full, the piece of equipment will level up and become stronger.<br/>Attack or defense might increase, upgrade limit increases, and rune slots might increase.

See [Equipment Growth](/system/gameplay-basics#equipment-growth) for details.

#### Synthesizing Equipment

You can synthesize weapons with weapons or shields with shields using a Synthesis Pot.<br/>
Once synthesized, the base item will have the items' abilities, and their upgrade value will be combined.

There's also a monster called Mixer which can synthesize items you throw at it.<br/>
This monster lets you synthesize different category items together, such as a weapon and grass item.

See [Synthesis](/system/gameplay-basics#synthesis) for details.

#### Equipment Tags

You can add tags to your weapons or shields at a shop, or by reading a Tag Scroll.<br/>
If you lose a tagged item, it'll be delivered to the Watchman's Lodge in Gonchiki Village.

However, there are some cases where a tagged item won't be delivered.

- Item was turned into a banana or Weeds due to a monster's special attack.
- Item was inserted into a Presto or Sale pot.
- Quit the game without suspending properly / game froze.

See [Equipment Tags](/system/gameplay-basics#equipment-tags) for details.

Items can be blessed, cursed, or sealed.

- Blessed items have stronger effects.
- Cursed equipment can't be unequipped.
- Sealed equipment can't gain skill points, upgrade value and runes are nullified.
- Sealed items (non-equipment) can't be used or have no effect.
- Curses and seals can be removed using items like Purify Scroll, Purify Pot, etc.
- Curses and seals can also be removed by Purifier NPCs in dungeons or villages.

See [Blessing / Curse / Seal](/system/gameplay-basics#blessing-/-curse-/-seal) for details.

#### Unidentified Items

Items with yellow names are unidentified items.<br/>
Use items such as Identify Scroll or Identify Pot to learn their true names and abilities.

### Dungeon Related

#### Dungeon Shops

Shops can appear in dungeons at times.

- If you want to buy something, pick it up and talk to the Shopkeeper to pay for it.
- If you want to sell something, place the item on the ground and talk to the Shopkeeper.

See [Shop](/system/dungeon-features#shop) for details.

#### Gimmicks

As you progress through dungeons, you'll encounter contraptions like doors, moving floors, and more.<br/>Some doors can be opened and closed using the O button, while others open when monsters aren't nearby.

See [Dungeon Features](/system/dungeon-features) for details.
