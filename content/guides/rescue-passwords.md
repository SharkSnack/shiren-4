## Overview

When a player goes on a rescue, the dungeon seed is set to the same seed as the player who collapsed.<br/>This means dungeon layout and items will be the same, resulting in the ability to share seeds with rare items.

## Notes

#### Using Passwords

- You can only go on a rescue if you've been to that dungeon and floor on your own before.
- Rescues that are successful, deleted, or result in failure 3 times are stored and can't be reused.
    - However, the history only stores 32 rescues, so you can reuse passwords after accepting 32 other rescues.
- Bring an Escape Scroll for rescues that allow carry-in items to obtain the listed items up to 3 times.

#### Creating Passwords

- You need to intentionally collapse on the next floor after finding target items, since the collapsed floor changes.
    - This is also the case for Pick-A-Choice shops.
- Shiny objects, enemy drops, correct Pick-A-Choice choices and prizes will be different.
