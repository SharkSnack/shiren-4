## Overview

Stealing is where you obtain items from a dungeon shop without having to pay for the items,<br/>
or where you sell all of your items and steal them back to obtain lots of Gitan.<br/><span class="redText">※ Tagged equipment lose their tags when sold.</span>

#### Thief Mode

- Thief Mode is triggered if you exit the shop when payment is due.
    - Generally, when merchandise was picked up, used, or lost.
    - Payment is not required for items lost due to Explochin or Pop Tank blasts.
- Thief Mode is also triggered if you enter an Elite Shop without showing an Invitation.
- Cannot escape from the dungeon with merchandise in inventory, or while Thief Mode is active.
    - Escape Scroll, Undo Grass
- Cannot request a rescue if you fail.
- All enemies become Shopkeepers, and new Shopkeepers are generated up to the character limit.
- New Shopkeepers won't be generated in the same room as Shiren when Thief Mode is triggered.

#### Changes from Previous Games

- Only 1 Shopkeeper per shop.
- Traps are never naturally generated in shops.
- Waiting for wind is pointless.
    - Wind granted Navigation Scroll's effect in earlier games.
- The Shopkeeper warps to you if you move to an entrance tile with merchandise in hand.
- Shopkeepers anger more easily.
    - Non-damaging actions like Swap Staff now turns them hostile.
- Shopkeepers of different colors appear instead of Sheriffs and Guard Dogs when stealing.
    - Status conditions are effective. Gold Shopkeepers have swift action speed.
- Shopkeepers ignore Sanctuary Scroll.

## Risk-Free

#### Zalokleft Pot

Place the merchandise you want to steal so that it's lined up with the shop's entrance, step outside the shop,<br/>and open the Zalokleft Pot while facing the items. (Note that you can't steal pots)<br/>The game doesn't count this as stealing, so Shopkeepers won't become hostile.

#### Pit Trap

The classic method where you create a Pit Trap inside a shop and step on it after picking up merchandise.<br/>Simply throw a Black Hole Pot at a wall, or have a Traproid create a Pit Trap inside the shop.<br/><span class="redText">※ This only works in dungeons with descending stairs.</span>

#### Floaty Warp

Lure 3 Floaty monsters into a shop, and get launched to a different floor after picking up merchandise.<br/>This method cannot be used if your shield has the <span class="greenText">Unmoving</span> rune.<br/>Miss Talisman can be used to avoid damage.

#### Monster Spawn Limit

There can be a maximum of 20 creatures on a floor, including Shiren and the Shopkeeper.<br/>
If you trap 18 monsters in a room using a Fortress Staff, new Shopkeepers won't spawn even in Thief Mode.<br/>Paralysis Staff can be used instead of Fortress Staff, but enemies will flow out of the room.

You can generate monsters without waiting for natural spawns by using items like:<br/>
Monster Pot, Zalokleft Pot, Monster Trap, Summon Trap.

## Some Risk

#### MC Mage

One of MC Mage's special attack effects includes the Transient effect (Warp to stairs → Paralyzed status).<br/>This method cannot be used if your shield has the <span class="greenText">Magic Damage</span> rune.<br/>Some methods to counter Paralyzed status:

- Starving status
    - You take 1 damage per turn while starving, which cancels Paralyzed status.
- Invincible Grass
    - Use it before getting hit by MC Mage's special attack.
    - Might wear off before an enemy attacks you while paralyzed.
- Revival Grass or Undo Grass
    - Cancel Paralyzed status by collapsing and being revived.

#### Wall Clip Bracelet + α

Effective when the stairs is along the wall and close to the shop, but watch your HP (10 damage per turn).<br/>You might need to cover exiting the wall with a different item, such as a Swap Staff from inside the wall.

#### Tunnel Staff / Rusty Pickaxe + α

Create a straight path to the stairs if the shop is lined up with the stairs,<br/>
then travel through the path using different items to take shortcuts if possible.<br/>
It's a good idea to paralyze the pursuing Shopkeeper using a Paralysis Staff.

#### Pinning Staff

Simply leap to the stairs. You might need to use a Fortress Staff if the stairs isn't along the wall.<br/>Use a Monster Detector to make sure there are no enemies in the stairs room to avoid Shopkeepers.<br/>Equip a Pierce Bracelet and use arrows from inside the shop to clear out enemies if needed.

#### Swap Staff

Position an enemy on the stairs using a Paralysis or Transient staff, then switch places with them.<br/>If the stairs is lined up but a wall is in the way, equip a Pierce Bracelet and throw the Swap Staff instead.<br/>Monster Detector helps ensure you don't accidentally switch places with an unintended enemy.

## Dangerous

#### Warp Grass

If there aren't many rooms, or you don't have anything on hand to help create a path,<br/>you can attempt to warp to the stairs using Warp Grass or a Pinning Staff (land on a water or air tile).<br/>However, there's far too much luck involved with warping to be practical, so it's not recommended.

#### Decoy Staff + α

Use Decoy Staff on Shopkeepers you encounter in hopes of distracting them long enough to gain distance.<br/>Success rate is pretty low, since you often get sandwiched inside a hallway.<br/>It helps to use items like Paralysis Staff, Swap Staff, Slumber Scroll, etc.

#### Night Abilities

Shut down Shopkeepers using Sticky Shot, Darkroom, etc. (Harder than Shiren 5 due to the lack of Pot Party)<br/>Generally successful if you make it to the stairs room, but it's common to get sandwiched in hallways.<br/><span class="blueText">※ Unlike Shiren 5, Three Screams is effective against Shopkeepers.</span>

If you get sandwiched in a hallway, use Bi-Direction Warp to send the Shopkeepers elsewhere.<br/>Otherwise, you'll need an item such as Warp Grass to escape the situation.
