## Overview

This guide explains best practices for identifying items in dungeons that don't allow carry-in items.<br/>Generally, checking selling price in a shop gives you lots of information to work with.<br/>See [Price Chart](/items/price-chart) for item prices.

## General

#### Never Unidentified

- Water Pot, Oil Pot, Blank Scroll, Escape Scroll, bananas, arrows, rocks

#### Cursed equipment

It's fine to ignore the risk of equipping cursed equipment near the start of the run.<br/>Keep items that have high upgrade value for synthesis, provided they don't have an unwanted rune.<br/>Don't equip unidentified items from mid game onward unless you have a way to unequip cursed items.<br/><span class="redText">※ Unlike Shiren 5, there are no bracelets that are guaranteed to be cursed in this game.</span>


If you equip a cursed item, use Strip Trap or selection-based scrolls.

- Heaven, Earth, Fixer, Plating, and Banana scrolls can be used to unequip a cursed item.
- Save Purify Scroll in case a pot gets sealed by a Curse Girl or Curse Trap.

#### Naming Unidentified Items

<div class="relativeImage smallScreenshot">
  <img src="../images/unsorted/naming_book.png" alt="Naming Book"/>
</div>

It's faster to name known unidentified items by selecting the name from the item book. (<span class="blueText">Book</span> command)<br/>If you find a shop, the standard approach is to name unknown unidentified items based on their price.<br/>For this example, say you have 3 scrolls worth 800 Gitan:

- First scroll → 8A
- Second scroll → 8B or 88
- Third scroll → 8C or 888

#### Identify Scroll / Identify Pot Priority

Priority varies depending on the dungeon and play style, but in general:

- Identify Scroll: Pots > Bracelets > Scrolls ≥ Grass
- Identify Pot: Bracelets > Scrolls ≥ Grass

Only use the above priority as a guideline, not as a hard rule.<br/>Consider the runes you've synthesized, difficulty of identification, and the item's potential value.

- If you haven't identified Dragon Grass, Warp Grass, etc. and are near Mixers, consider prioritizing grass.
- If you've identified key items, prioritize staves / check for seals on Revival Grass or Heal Pot.

#### N'mach and N'dup

Disguised N'mach and N'dup can't be revealed using an Identify Scroll or Identify Pot.<br/>
Only use items you can trust 100% in situations where you can't afford to make a mistake.

## Synthesis

#### Weapon, Shield, Staff

The result is identified if one of the items used in synthesis is identified - Order doesn't matter.<br/>Example: Beast Fang+2 and Katana+? (+1) = Beast Fang+3<br/>

The result is also identified if the 2 items result in a rune being synthesized, even if they were unidentified.<br/>Example: Beast Fang+? (+1) and Dull Gold Edge+? (+2) = Beast Fang+3 (Rustproof)

#### Mixer Identification

<div class="relativeImage monsterImage">
  <img src="../images/monsters/mixer.png" alt="Mixer"/>
</div>

Eaten items will be identified if synthesis succeeds.<br/><span class="redText">※ Unlike Shiren 5, the unidentified items must be thrown before equipment.</span>

For this example, Green Grass is Herb:

- Green Grass → Dotanuki = Dotanuki (<span class="greenText">HP+5</span>), Herb <span class="blueText">is</span> identified.
- Dotanuki → Green Grass = Dotanuki (<span class="greenText">HP+5</span>), Herb <span class="redText">is not</span> identified.

## Bracelets

#### Price

|Buy|Sell|Bracelets|Notes|
|-|-|-|-|
|2000|700|Strength, Pierce, Bad Aim|Equip and check strength → shoot an arrow to identify.|
|3000|1050|Holy, Alert, Calm, Cleansing, Regret, Trap<br/>Staunch, Monster Summoner|Curse, Sleep, Spin, or Poison Arrow traps can be used to test,<br/>but it's best to use an Identify Scroll or Identify Pot.|
|5000|1750|Monster Detector, Item Detector, Wall Clip,<br/>Heal, Strider, Warp, Alleyway, Explosion|Equip to check for Monster Detector and Item Detector,<br/>then step in place to check for Heal, Explosion, and Warp.<br/>Try attacking through a corner to check for Wall Clip.<br/>Build a wall using Fortress Staff to check for Alleyway.<br/><span class="redText">※ It's dangerous to check for Explosion and Warp in shops.</span>|
|10000|3500|Happy, Bind|Equip and check experience points to identify.|
|30000|10500|Scout, Identify, Trapper, Bulldog|Equip to check for Scout → pick up an unidentified item.<br/>Trapper and Bulldog are obtained in specific dungeons,<br/>so you don't need to consider them as possibilities.|

#### Testing for Effects

- Instantly determined after equipping:
    - Strength increased by 3 → Strength
    - Experience points increased by 1 → Happy
    - Enemy positions revealed → Monster Detector
    - Item positions revealed → Item Detector
    - Enemy and item positions revealed → Scout (Elite or Pick-A-Choice)
    - Traps revealed → Trapper Bracelet (Trap Zone)
- Determined by walking:
    - Heal 3 HP per turn or fullness depletes faster → Heal
    - Can pass through walls or attack through corners → Wall Clip
    - Can walk on water → Strider
    - Warped to a different location → Warp
    - Suddenly exploded → Explosion
    - Hidden hallway or room was revealed → Alleyway
- Throw or pick up an item:

    - Thrown item pierces through walls → Pierce
    - The item you picked up became identified → Identify (Elite or Pick-A-Choice)
- Resonated with a weapon:
    - Baffle Axe → Calm
    - Nap Rattle → Alert
- Situational:
    - Monsters spawn faster (requires Navigation Scroll) → Monster Summoner
    - New trap was generated (requires Sharp Eyes status) → Trap
    - Received a brutal hit from an enemy attack → Regret
- Other:
    - The 4 remaining possibilities are Cleansing, Staunch, Holy, and Bind.

## Grass

It's best to identify grasses using a combination of checking prices and Mixer synthesis instead of using them,<br/>since many grasses offer powerful runes like <span class="greenText">Anti-Fire</span>, <span class="greenText">Anti-Floating</span>, <span class="greenText">Sedating</span>, etc. when synthesized.

General guidelines:

- Make sure enemies and shopkeepers are not nearby in case it inflicts a status like Berserk.
- Don't have a Wall Clip Bracelet equipped, or else you might suffocate in a wall from Berserk status.
- Don't have shop merchandise in your inventory, especially if it's a 100G grass. (Possibly Warp Grass)
- Don't eat if obtained from Elite or Pick-A-Choice shops. (Possibly Imabikiso, Amnesia, Disaster Seed)

#### Price

|Buy|Sell|Grasses|Notes|
|-|-|-|-|
|50|17|Herb|Only 1 item in this price range.|
|100|35|Otogiriso, Antidote, Warp, Poison|Warp and Antidote provide key runes, so don't eat.|
|200|70|Heal Grass|Only 1 item in this price range.|
|300|105|Dizzy, Blind, Swift, Growth, Sight, Power Up,<br/>Expand, Shrink|Nothing too special, so it's fine to eat.|
|500|175|Dragon, Life, Sleep, Strength, Rage|Dragon, Sleep, and Life provide key runes,<br/>and Rage is extremely dangerous, so don't eat.|
|1000|350|Revival Grass|Only 1 item in this price range.|
|1500|525|Undo Grass|Only 1 item in this price range.|
|2000|700|Happy, Unlucky, Imabikiso, Amnesia, Invincible|Extremely dangerous, so don't eat.|
|5000|1750|Angel, Disaster|Disaster can end your run, so don't eat.|

#### Monster Drop

Mutaikon monsters drop specific grass:

- Mutaikon → Poison Grass
- Dazikon → Dizzy Grass
- Dozikon → Sleep Grass
- Mesmerikon → Rage Grass

## Scrolls

It's safest to read scrolls while standing on the stairs right before advancing to the next floor in case it turns out<br/>to be a dangerous scroll like Muzzled, Grounded, Attraction, Mon House, etc., but you could also read it while<br/>standing on an entrance tile of a room if you're hoping for a Mon House Scroll.

Scrolls that have you select an item should be used on a secondary weapon or shield that you don't mind losing.<br/>You can synthesize the item if it's Plating, Heaven, or Earth, but can't reclaim your main equipment if it's Banana.<br/>Escape, Blank, and Invitation are always found identified. 300G scrolls are always Identify Scroll.<br/><span class="redText">※ Unlike Shiren 5, Identify Scroll cannot be given to a Shopkeeper to identify merchandise.</span>

#### Blind Reading

It's possible to check if a scroll is a selection-based scroll without consuming the item by attempting to read it<br/>at night without a light source, or while Shiren is afflicted with Blind status. (Blind Trap, Squid King, etc.)

#### Price

|Buy|Sell|Scrolls|Notes|
|-|-|-|-|
|100|35|Navigation|Only 1 item in this price range.|
|300|105|Identify|Only 1 item in this price range, selection-based.|
|500|175|Purify, Heaven, Earth, Plating, Tag,<br/>Suction, Pot God, Banana|Selection-based.<br/>Read it on an unneeded item in case it's Banana.|
|800|280|Medicine, Fear, Desert, Trap Erase,<br/>Trap, Attraction, Muzzled, Grounded|Many dangerous effects, so read while on stairs.<br/>It's worth throwing at Mixer in case it's Desert.|
|1000|350|Confusion, Slumber, Fixer, Air Slash,<br/>Replenish, Dispel Aura, Mon House,<br/>Swift Foe, Night-Day|Many useful effects against groups of enemies.<br/>However, it's best to read while on stairs in case it's<br/>Mon House or Swift Foe.|
|3000|1050|Sanctuary, Lost, Eradicate|Place on ground to identify Sanctuary.|
|10000|3500|Extinction|Only 1 item in this price range. (Elite, Pick-A-Choice)|

#### Write on Blank Scroll

If you write on a Blank Scroll, all instances of the scroll you wrote becomes identified on the spot.<br/>This technique ensures that the first usage of a valuable scroll doesn't go to waste.

- Example 1:
    1. Found a Blank Scroll on 1F, and wrote "Fixer Scroll" on it.
    2. Advanced to 3F, and found an already identified Fixer Scroll on the ground.
- Example 2:
    1. Found a Blank Scroll on 1F.
    2. Advanced to 3F, and found an unidentified scroll called "Crow Scroll". (Actually a Fixer Scroll)
    3. Wrote "Fixer Scroll" on the Blank Scroll, and "Crow Scroll" turned into "Fixer Scroll".

## Pots

"Open" type pots can be identified by using them, and "Insert" type pots can often be identified by price.<br/>It's hard to deduce what the pot is by inserting an item if you don't know the price, but capacity serves as a hint.<br/><span class="redText">※ Unlike Shiren 5, Synthesis Pot can be found in capacities other than 5.</span>

#### Capacity (Insert Type)

|C|Pots|
|-|-|
|2|Purify, Curse, Blessing, Mailing, Black Hole, Upgrade, Degrade|
|3|(All pots)|
|4|Storage, Identify, 4-2-8, Ordinary, Hide, Sale, Presto, Sticky, Sturdy, Chocolate, Synthesis, Mailing, Black Hole|
|5|Storage, Identify, 4-2-8, Ordinary, Hide, Sale, Presto, Sticky, Sturdy, Chocolate, Synthesis|

#### Price

Price shifts based on capacity - listed values are for 3 capacity.

|Buy|Sell|Pots|Notes|
|-|-|-|-|
|690|241|Storage, Identify, Ordinary, 4-2-8, Hide|Insert an unidentified item to check for Storage, Identify, Hide.|
|1150|402|Sale, Presto, Sticky, Sturdy, Chocolate|Insert a rock or arrow to check for Sale, Presto, Sticky.<br/>If none of the above, insert a banana OR name it Chocolate and<br/>throw at a wall - If it didn't shatter, change its name to Sturdy.|
|1840|544|Purify, Curse, Blessing|Blessing can't be found on the ground.<br/>Insert an unneeded item. (Not an arrow, rock, or talisman)|
|2875|1006|Mailing, Black Hole|Black Hole can't be found in shops.<br/>The item inserted into Mailing Pot falls to the ground if the<br/>Boronga Village storehouse is full.|
|4370|1529|Heal, Zalokleft, Monster|Open the pot in a hallway or while on stairs in case it's Monster.|
|6900|2415|Synthesis|Only 1 item in this price range.|
|11500|4025|Upgrade, Degrade|Insert an identified weapon, shield or staff.|

#### Insert Type

1. Verify where you obtained the pot:
    - Each dungeon has its own Elite/Pick-A-Choice exclusive, shop-exclusive, floor-exclusive items.
        - Blessing, Upgrade, Degrade - Often Elite or Pick-A-Choice.
        - Mailing - Often Shop, Elite, or Pick-A-Choice.
        - Sale, Black Hole - Often not found in shops.
2. Pot has a capacity of 2:
    - Found on the ground → Purify, Curse, or Black Hole
    - Insert an unneeded item (Not an arrow, rock, or talisman)
        - Item vanished → Black Hole
        - Item became cursed or sealed → Curse
        - Nothing happened, or item was purified → Purify
3. Pot has a capacity of 5:
    - Not Purify, Curse, or Black Hole.
    - Might be Sticky, so check while on stairs before advancing to the next floor.
    - Select <span class="blueText">Insert</span> to check for Hide.
    - Next, insert an unneeded unidentified item.
        - Hand got stuck → Sticky
        - Item turned into Gitan → Sale
        - Item turned into a different item → Presto
        - Item became identified → Identify
        - Can remove the item → Storage
        - Nothing happened → Continue to step 4.
4. Hard to identify pots:
    - Remaining possibilities are Ordinary, 4-2-8, Sturdy, Chocolate, and Synthesis.
    - If you have plenty of food, insert a banana to check for Chocolate.
    - If you have extra weapons, shields, or staves, insert 2 of the same type to check for Synthesis.
    - If none of the above, continue to step 5.
5. Throw the pot at a wall:
    - Name the pot something like "Ord428" to cover both possibilities, then throw the pot.
        - Pot didn't shatter → Sturdy
        - Pot exploded → 4-2-8
        - Pot shattered → Ordinary

#### Open Type

- Open the pot:
    - Do so in a hallway or while standing on stairs in case it's a Monster Pot.
        - Placing Banana Peels around you ensures safety.
    - Place an item you'd like to store in front of you in case it's a Zalokleft Pot.
- Throw the pot at a wall:
    - Only do this after Heal Pot has been identified.
    - Monsters appeared → Monster
    - Zaloklefts appeared → Zalokleft
    - Nothing happened → Heal

## Staves

Most staves can be identified by swinging them at a monster.<br/>
Price can still be checked to narrow down possibilities, but it's mostly used to check remaining uses.

General guidelines:

- Swing from at least 2 tiles away for safety.
- Don't swing at Gyaza or Absorbiphant monsters.
- Choose a weak monster in case it's Swift, Pinning, or Happy.
- If it inflicts Slow status, assume it's Mage until you're certain it's Slow.

#### Price

Price shifts based on remaining uses - listed values are for 5 uses.

|Buy|Sell|Staves|Notes|
|-|-|-|-|
|1250|437|Knockback, Swap, Pinning,<br/>Mage, Swift, Slow, Lightning|Mage and Slow effects can overlap.|
|1875|656|Empathy, Balance, Trap Erase,<br/>Ordinary, Transient, Paralysis|No effect → Balance or Ordinary.|
|2500|875|Seal, Decoy|Easily determined by swinging.|
|3750|1312|Tunnel, Fortress|Swing at a wall from at least 2 tiles away.|
|5000|1750|Happy, Unlucky|Swing at a weak Lv2\~3 monster.|

#### Use Count

A staff's initial use count can be used alongside its price to narrow down possibilities.

|Use|Staves|
|-|-|
|4|Swift, Slow, Lightning, Transient, Paralysis, Seal, Decoy, Tunnel, Fortress, Happy, Unlucky|
|7|Swap, Knockback, Pinning, Mage, Empathy, Trap Erase, Balance, Ordinary|
|5~6|(Could be either group)|

## Talismans

Talismans can't be identified by price because they all cost 500G, so throw them at monsters instead.<br/><span class="redText">※ Unlike Shiren 5, there isn't a talisman that levels up a target in this game.</span>

General guidelines:

- Beware of Swift, Rage, Fury.
    - Throw at a single weak monster from at least 2 tiles away.
- Beware of Berserk.
    - Throw when there are no other monsters in the room.

#### Price

|Buy|Sell|Talismans|Notes|
|-|-|-|-|
|500|175|Sleep, Seal, Dizzy, Miss, Fear, Bind,<br/>Swift, Slow, Berserk, Rage, Fury|All talismans cost 500 G.|
