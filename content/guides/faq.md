## English Patch

### Patching the game

The English Patch created by SharkSnack, Arc Impulse, and DhrGR has not been released yet.<br/>
We're aiming for a 2022 release, but there are some unknowns which make it hard to give an exact ETA.

### Providing feedback

Join the [Shiren the Wanderer](https://discord.gg/5y7UDFc) Discord server and post in #shiren-4-english (under Patches/Hacks).

Save state usage can cause issues including corrupt and unusable save data,<br/>so don't bother reporting errors if you use save states.

### Does this game run on X device?

The patch currently does not run on original hardware.<br/>
However, it should run on anything that can run PPSSPP.

## Version Differences

### PSP version changes / additions

#### New dungeons

- Asura Realm
- Mystery Shopping Mall
- Grass and Scroll Cave

#### Twitter Integration

- Link a Twitter account to tweet screenshots, rescue requests, revival spells, etc.

#### Widescreen

- Widescreen makes it much easier to play the game, since you don't have to constantly Scout.
- Changes to go with the new screen size:
    - The area illuminated by Super Torch was adjusted.
    - Monsters can spawn in visible areas, provided they're outside of the DS screen size's area.

#### Other details

- Arrows, rocks, talismans can no longer be blessed, cursed, or sealed.
- The tsunami dungeon event was removed.
- Shopkeepers ask for payment every turn instead of only the first turn you move to a shop entrance tile.
- Music tracks from Asuka Kenzan and GB2 were replaced with different tracks.
- Can insert same name talismans, arrows, rocks into pots even if the pot is full.
    - Requires update 2.00.
- Lots of bugfixes.

## Before Playing

### Is this a good starting point for the series?

Shiren the Wanderer games have self-contained stories, so you'll be fine regarding the story.<br/>
The game also features a facility called Novice House, which covers gameplay basics.

### How's the difficulty?

The main story of Shiren 4 is on the harder side within this series.<br/>
However, if you use Escape Scrolls or Undo Grass and take things slowly, it's not too difficult.

If you've played through earlier games, it may be tricky to adjust to new mechanics or changes, such as:

- New: Night, Equipment growth, Bananas
- Changes: Identification, Price calculation, Slower HP regeneration as max HP increases

## Main Story

### Gameplay Related

#### What are the basic mechanics?

→ [Gameplay Basics](/system/gameplay-basics)

#### HP Regeneration seems slow...

Unlike past games, HP doesn't regenerate when you attack.<br/>This means you have to move or step in place (A+B) to regenerate HP.

HP regeneration is fast at first, but drastically slows down as your max HP increases.<br/>So as you progress, the game pushes you to learn techniques to avoid damage instead of trading hits.<br/>→ [HP Regeneration](/system/gameplay-basics#hp-regeneration)

#### Growth status?

Equipped weapons and shields earn growth experience points when you defeat enemies using direct attacks.<br/>Once the item gains enough points, it levels up and gains a new name + increased stats.

Growth status is a status condition which multiplies the amount of points you earn by 4.<br/>
→ [Equipment Growth](/system/gameplay-basics#equipment-growth)

#### Equipment Tags?

Tags can be placed on weapons or shields, and ensures the item goes to a specific village if lost.<br/>Up to 8 tags can be placed on items, and the tag is erased when you pick the item up.<br/>
→ [Equipment Tags](/system/gameplay-basics#equipment-tags)

#### Why are leveled up night monsters so strong?

Night monster attack power seems to use the formula of [ Attack power x Level ],<br/>and the amount of damage you receive is [ Enemy attack power - Defense ].

This means if a night monster has 100 attack and you have 90 defense, you'd take 10 damage.<br/>If the 100 attack power monster levels up, it'd have 200 attack and you'd now take 110 damage.

#### What's the damage received formula?

Simplified to give a quick idea:

|Formula|
|-|
|[ Enemy attack x Variance - Shiren's defense ]|

※ Shiren's defense is roughly equal to shield strength x 0.6<br/>
※ Variance is roughly 0.9 ~ 1.1

### Item Related

#### Do you gain skill points with Flame Shot?

No, you need to defeat enemies using direct attacks to gain skill points.

#### When do wandering NPCs return my items?

It's random. They can appear on the next floor, or it might be a few adventures from now.<br/>
You can use a Calling Pot to force them to appear if you have one on hand.

#### I got a different item back from the Smith Shop?

You most likely handed the item to the Iron Upgrader NPC instead of the Smith Shop NPC.

#### What happens when a weapon or shield is sealed?

Unlike curses, you can equip and unequip the item freely.<br/>However, runes and upgrade value are nullified, and the item can't gain growth experience points.

#### Do Bright Blade or Breeze Blade abilities improve with level?

No, Bright Blade is always 1 critical after 2 misses, and Breeze Blade is always 3 forward directions.

#### Do runes get stronger if you synthesize higher level equipment?

No, runes are always the Lv1 effect.<br/>
Synthesizing a Lv1 Lizard Lasher and Lv8 Dragon's Bain provides the exact same Anti-Dragon rune.

#### How do you remove Sticky Pot?

The Sticky Pot will be removed if you advance floors or step on a Strip Trap.<br/>
It also has a chance to shatter when you attack a monster or get hit by a monster's attack.

### Monster Related

#### How do you synthesize with Mixers?

Simply throw the items you wish to synthesize at the Mixer.<br/>
Mixers won't eat items if they're asleep, paralyzed, or slipping on a Banana Peel.

#### Gyaza is too strong!

Some ideas to help:

- Use a Water Cutter as a main weapon.
- Synthesize the Anti-Aquatic rune onto your weapon. (Water Cutter or Desert Scroll)
- Synthesize status inflicting runes onto your weapon. (Paralyzing, Sedating, etc.)

#### What do I do about N'mach / N'dup inside the storehouse?

You can't identify disguised N'mach / N'dup using Identify Scroll or Identify Bracelet.

Lose the items:

1. Sell suspicious items.

Keep the items:

1. Withdraw suspicious items.
2. Go to Emerald Terrace and find a N'dubba type monster. (13-18F, 24-36F)
3. Throw an Extinction Scroll at the N'dubba type monster.
    - Any disguised N'mach or N'dup will be converted into real items.

### Gameplay Related

#### Any missables?

Nothing is permanently missable, but there are 2 items that become tricky to reobtain if you lose them.

The 2 items are <span class="orangeText">Sturdy Hammer</span> and <span class="orangeText">Jaguar's Shield</span>.

Sturdy Hammer is a first time clear reward from a certain dungeon, and can otherwise only be obtained<br/>from elite shops deep within that same dungeon.

Jaguar's Shield is a clear reward from a difficult 99F dungeon, and you can only have 1 at any given time.

Both items are requested by a certain character during a side quest, so if you level either item up,<br/>you can no longer use the item for that side quest and have to reobtain a Lv1 version of the item again.

So to avoid complications with these 2 items:

1. Once obtained, place a tag on the item.
2. Keep the item in storage without using or modifying it.
3. When the character asks for the item, give it to them.
    - Since the item is tagged, you can go reclaim it at the Watchman's Lodge afterward.
4. Once you're past that point of the character's side quest, feel free to level it for the item book.

#### Where should I go first?

Players usually start with any of the following dungeons:

|Dungeon|Info|
|-|-|
|Cave of Endless Night<br/>Banana Kingdom<br/>Trap Zone|Easy due to shallow target floor (1st clear).|
|Static Forest<br/>Double Strike Cave|Harder than the above.|
|Bayside Monster Cave|The "Fay's Final Puzzle" / Primordial Chasm" of this game.|
|Platinum Paradise|If you enjoy bringing items into dungeons.|

### Item Related

#### What's the banana icon in some item descriptions?

It means the item grants an ability when thrown at Banana Prince.<br/>
→ [Bana Powers](/system/bana-powers)

#### How do I obtain a blessed Blessing Pot?

Some ideas:

- Intentionally seal a Blessing Pot, then take it to a Purifier and hope it gets blessed. (Random chance)
- Use a Rescue Password.

#### Where do I find X?

|Item|Location|
|-|-|
|Extinction Scroll<br/>Eradicate Scroll|Bayside Monster Cave (Pick-A-Choice), Scribe (NPC)|
|Calling Pot|Shiny Object (Blue), Pick-A-Choice, Bargain Hunter (NPC), Platinum Paradise (Elite Shop), etc.|
|Happy Staff<br/>Balance Staff|Bayside Monster Cave or Entrancing Lane (Collapse on 3F and use Interim Adventure)|
|Bulldog Bracelet<br/>Jaguar's Shield<br/>Kamina's Sword|Clear the corresponding dungeon.<br/>The same item must not already be in inventory, storehouse, or warehouse.|
|Trapper Bracelet|Clear the corresponding dungeon (1st clear), Trap Zone (Shop)|
|True Knife|Level up the ally who joins after clearing Entrancing Lane to Lv100.|
|Drain Arrow<br/>Critical Arrow<br/>Killer Arrow|Shops inside dungeons.|

#### Can you reobtain clear reward items?

※ The conditions are intentionally kept slightly vague to avoid spoilers.

|Item|Condition|
|-|-|
|Kamina's Sword|Same location when not in inventory, storehouse, or warehouse.|
|Jaguar's Shield|Same location when not in inventory, storehouse, or warehouse.|
|Bulldog Bracelet|99F of same dungeon when not in inventory, storehouse, or warehouse.|
