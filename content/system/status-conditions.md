## Overview

Status conditions are states that affect a character's behavior in various ways.<br/>
All statuses besides "Normal" can be categorized as positive or negative.

For information about auras, check the [Gameplay Basics](/system/gameplay-basics) page.

#### Shiren

- Negative statuses can be removed by items like <span class="orangeText">Fixer Scroll</span> or <span class="orangeText">Medicine Scroll</span>.
    - <span class="orangeText">Heal Pot</span>, <span class="orangeText">Heal Grass</span>, and <span class="orangeText">Otogiriso</span> can also cure some negative statuses.
- You can check your current status from the menu. (Other â†’ Current Status)
- Most status conditions wear off after a number of turns, or when you change floors.
- Being revived by Revival Grass or Undo Grass will remove all status conditions.

#### Allies

- Negative statuses can be removed by <span class="orangeText">Medicine Scroll</span>.

#### Monsters

- Negative statuses can be removed by a <span class="orangeText">Revitalize Trap</span>.
