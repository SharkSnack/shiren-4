# Overview

Wanderer Rescue is a system where you can request help from other players up to 3 times if you collapse.<br/>
Rescue requests are usually made using a password you input manually.

The rescuing player must enter and locate the collapsed player inside a dungeon to rescue them.<br/>
(The dungeon will have the same seed, meaning items, map layout, enemies, etc. will be identical)

Once the collapsed player receives a revival spell, they can continue their adventure without item loss.<br/>
The rescuer will be rewarded with an item and can receive a reward letter from the other player.

# Requesting

### Requirements (Request)

- There must be remaining rescues.<br/>You can be rescued up to 3 times - once you've used those up, you'll fail the adventure.

- Thief Mode must not be active.<br/>You can't request a rescue if you collapse while in Thief Mode.<br/>If a Shopkeeper became hostile without triggering Thief Mode, you can still be rescued.

- You must not be waiting for a rescue / currently attempting a rescue.<br/>Requests can't be sent if you collapse while waiting for a rescue, or if you collapse while attempting a rescue.

### Passwords

</div>

Share a rescue request in the form of a 54 character password.<br/>
The password never expires and works offline.

Passwords can also be used to share dungeon seeds that have rare items.<br/>(See <a href="/guides/rescue-passwords">Rescue Passwords</a>)

### Adventure while waiting

Go on adventures while waiting to be rescued. (Waiting for rescue → Adventure while waiting)

This can be an excellent way to obtain rare items.

- You can only enter dungeons you've been to before, and only as deep as your personal best depth.
- You can't request a rescue if you collapse.

# Rescuing

- The rescue must be in a dungeon you've been to before.<br/>The target floor must be less than or equal to your personal best depth.

- You must not be waiting for a rescue.<br/>Rescues can't be attempted while you're waiting to be rescued.
