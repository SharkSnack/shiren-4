# Overview

Expert Badges are in-game achievements obtained by clearing dungeons with self-imposed restrictions.<br/>Unlike Shiren 5, challenges in this game are shared across all dungeons.

The 16 challenges are unlocked after clearing the main story.<br/>
※ Emerald Terrace doesn't count for challenges, since it continues into Platinum Paradise.

The game won't notify you if you fail an Expert Badge condition during an adventure,<br/>so you'll have to keep track of your own actions.

Each section on this page assumes you're attempting <span class="orangeText">one challenge</span> at a time.

# Information

Platinum Paradise is the easiest dungeon to obtain badges in outside of the 2 dungeon-specific challenges:

- Clear without synthesizing! (Bayside Monster Cave)
- Clear without using moves! (Entrancing Lane)

#### Cautions

- Clearing means advancing past the deepest floor of a dungeon.
- Clearing Emerald Terrace (36F) doesn't count.
    - This is because the dungeon continues to Platinum Paradise.
- Obtaining badges by clearing Platinum Paradise requires starting from 1F.
    - Sort your items and then enter a dungeon → read an Escape Scroll before the attempt.
    - Don't use shops or warehouses during the attempt to avoid accidental usage.
- Clearing Grass and Scroll Cave nets lots of badges due to its limited item categories.
    - Categories (floor): Grass, scroll, torch
    - Categories (monster drop): Food, arrow, rock.
    - Revival Grass is incredibly rare.

### No Weapons

|Challenge|In-Game Description|
|-|-|
|Clear without weapons!|Clear a dungeon without equipping any<br/>weapons. Try for it anywhere other than<br/><span class="orangeText">Double Strike Cave</span>!|

Primary means of dealing damage are arrows and rocks.<br/>Bored Kappas can force you to equip a weapon if they throw one at you, so keep your inventory full.<br/>Cave of Endless Night is easiest, since you don't use direct attacks at night anyway.<br/>Torches don't count as weapons, so they can be equipped.

### No Shields / Bracelets

|Challenge|In-Game Description|
|-|-|
|Clear without shields/bracelets!|Clear a dungeon without equipping any<br/>shields or bracelets. Try for it anywhere<br/>other than <span class="orangeText">Double Strike Cave</span>!|

Trading hits with 0 defense is incredibly dangerous, and it's hard to recover from accidents like traps,<br/>getting hit at night, higher level Fearabbits, Radishes, Archdragons, etc.<br/>
Floors that limit your field of view in hallways raise the difficulty even further.<br/>
Cave of Endless Night is easiest, since you want to avoid getting hit at night anyway.

### No Rocks / Arrows

|Challenge|In-Game Description|
|-|-|
|Clear without rocks/arrows!|Clear a dungeon without throwing rocks<br/>or shooting arrows.|

Not difficult as long as you don't attempt it in Trap Zone or Double Strike Cave.<br/>Cave of Endless Night and Platinum Paradise are easiest.

### No Food

|Challenge|In-Game Description|
|-|-|
|Clear without eating food!|Clear a dungeon without eating food.|

Fixer Scroll and Revival Grass are your primary methods to replenish fullness.<br/>Diet Shield (<span class="greenText">1/2 Hunger</span>) is significantly helps.<br/>Platinum Paradise and Jaguar's Hunting Forest are easiest.

### No Grass

|Challenge|In-Game Description|
|-|-|
|Clear without using grasses!|Clear a dungeon without using grass.<br/>This includes throwing it or reviving<br/>with Revival Grass or Undo Grass.|

The only way to revive is to use Wanderer Rescue, and your Mixer synthesis options are limited.<br/>If attempting in a dungeon that allows carry-in items, bring an Undo Grass and escape if you collapse.<br/>Static Forest is difficult with low max HP, so it's recommended to challenge it elsewhere.<br/>If you don't use Wanderer Rescue or NPCs, you'll also obtain "Clear without collapsing!".

### No Scrolls

|Challenge|In-Game Description|
|-|-|
|Clear without using scrolls!|Clear a dungeon without using scrolls.<br/>This includes throwing it anywhere,<br/>placing a Sanctuary Scroll,<br/>or eating a Squid Sushi Scroll.|

Makes it harder to deal with Monster Houses, cursed equipment, and sealed items.<br/>If a defeated enemy drops a scroll that sticks to the ground, you'll fail the challenge.<br/>Not very difficult outside of Entrancing Lane.

### No Staves

|Challenge|In-Game Description|
|-|-|
|Clear without using staves!|Clear a dungeon without using staves.<br/>This includes throwing it anywhere.|

Lack of movement options makes escaping from situations and stealing from shops difficult,<br/>and it's also harder to safely cycle time of day.

### No Talismans

|Challenge|In-Game Description|
|-|-|
|Clear without using talismans!|Clear a dungeon without using talismans.<br/>This includes throwing it anywhere.|

Likely the easiest challenge in terms of item category restrictions.

### No Pots

|Challenge|In-Game Description|
|-|-|
|Clear without using pots!|Clear a dungeon without using pots.<br/>This includes throwing a Hide Pot<br/>or making a 4-2-8 Pot explode.|

Pots can't be used to increase your inventory size, and you can't synthesize items without Mixers.<br/>Pots thrown by Bored Kappa monsters might make you fail the challenge, depending on the pot.

### No Collapsing

|Challenge|In-Game Description|
|-|-|
|Clear without collapsing!|Clear a dungeon without collapsing.<br/>This includes using Revival Grass,<br/>Undo Grass, or Wanderer Rescue.|

Easiest in dungeons that allow carry-in items.<br/>Jaguar's Hunting Forest becomes somewhat thrilling.

### No Synthesizing

|Challenge|In-Game Description|
|-|-|
|Clear without synthesizing!|Clear a dungeon without synthesizing.<br/>This includes synthesizing using Mixers.<br/>Try for it in <span class="orangeText">Bayside Monster Cave</span>!|

Runes are essential to raising your damage output, adding defensive abilities, and grouping staves.<br/>Use Monster Detector + Wall Clip Bracelet as a set to overcome this difficult challenge.

### Level 99

|Challenge|In-Game Description|
|-|-|
|Clear after reaching level 99!|Clear a dungeon after reaching level <span class="tealText">99</span>!|

Level up an Elizgagon to Elizgagon99, and then use a Trapper Bracelet to add an exp multiplier of x20.<br/>If challenging it in a dungeon that doesn't allow carry-in items, it's easiest in Trap Zone or Entrancing Lane.

### 999,999 Gitan

|Challenge|In-Game Description|
|-|-|
|Clear with 999,999 Gitan!|Clear a dungeon with <span class="tealText">999,999</span> Gitan!|

Withdraw 999,999 Gitan from your bank account and clear a dungeon that allows carry-in items.<br/>If challenging it in a dungeon that doesn't allow carry-in items, you'll need to steal from shops<br/>and make it a point to hunt Froggos, Gitan Mamels, and Ultra Gazers.

### 3 Allies

|Challenge|In-Game Description|
|-|-|
|Clear with 3 allies!|Clear a dungeon with <span class="tealText">3</span> allies!|

Level up your allies to Lv10 beforehand, and prepare an assortment of powerful items.<br/>Recruit allies at the Tavern in Boronga Village, or while progressing through Emerald Terrace.<br/>Use Monster Detector + Transient Staff to locate the stairs and rush through the dungeon.<br/>Bring lots of Blank Scrolls and don't hesitate to use Expulsion Scroll, etc. if an ally is in danger.<br/>Throw Extinction Scrolls at Pop Tank monsters, Archdragons, Abyssal Dragons.<br/>Easiest in Platinum Paradise or Cave of Endless Night.

### No Moves

|Challenge|In-Game Description|
|-|-|
|Clear without using moves!|Clear a dungeon without using moves!<br/>Try for it in <span class="orangeText">Entrancing Lane</span>!|

The start of the run is tricky, but otherwise it mostly plays out the same.<br/>
Corner a Rare Snacky (8 HP) in a room at night and punch it in hopes of obtaining a blessed Blank Scroll.<br/>Blessed Gitan deals 10 damage to night monsters, so it can one-shot a Rare Snacky.<br/>After that, use the blessed Suction Scroll loop technique to progress through the dungeon,<br/>and read Light Scrolls to rush stairs from about mid ~ late game.

### No Direct Attacks

|Challenge|In-Game Description|
|-|-|
|Clear without direct attacks!|Clear a dungeon without dealing any<br/>damage using direct attacks.<br/>Whiffed attacks are OK!|

Easy in Cave of Endless Night, but a nightmare in daytime-only dungeons other than Double Strike Cave.
