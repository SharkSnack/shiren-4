## Overview

Allies are NPC characters who fight monsters alongside Shiren.<br/>
There are 8 ally characters - Millie, Edna, Galwin, Saruma Brothers, Banana Prince, and Borg Mamel.<br/>
Each character comes with a unique ability, and can grow stronger through leveling up.

Those looking for a more classic roguelike experience can play without allies,<br/>but since most post-game dungeons don't allow allies, it might be fun to experience them while you can.

### Ally Behavior

Turn order: Shiren → Allies → Monsters.<br/>
※ If there was a disguised N'mach: Shiren → N'mach → Allies → Monsters.

If a dungeon allows allies, you can bring up to 3 allies with you.<br/>
If you recruit a 4th ally during an adventure, you can choose who to leave behind.

All allies except for Galwin and Borg Mamel prioritize following Shiren.<br/>
They generally won't attack monsters who aren't an immediate threat.<br/>(Example: Napping or paralyzed monsters)

Allies follow you when you switch places with a wandering NPC.<br/>
Doors wait to close until Shiren and all allies pass through the door.<br/>
However, special doors still close immediately if a monster is present in the room you enter.

If an ally is defeated, the monster that defeated the ally levels up.<br/>

Unlike Shiren 5, allies DO NOT dodge flying equipment, including equipment disarmed by a Kengo.<br/>

### Ally Stats



Maximum level of 10, and level ups persist between adventures.<br/>
Due to this, they typically require more experience points to level up.<br/>
It's easiest to use items like Happy Grass to level them up once they reach high levels.<br/>
※ Borg Mamel's maximum level is 99, and isn't based on experience points.

Experience points are distributed to all party members regardless of who defeated the monster.<br/>The amount of experience points doesn't change based on number of party members.

Except for Galwin, allies follow you to the next floor even if you were in different rooms.<br/>Levels can be gained or lost by level-changing items such as Happy Grass or Unlucky Staff,<br/>but allies who are in wandering NPC mode aren't affected.<br/>

Unlike Shiren 5, this game doesn't have a way to display ally HP.<br/>
You can talk to them to get a rough idea, but keep in mind that talking is a turn ending action.<br/>

Herb, Otogiriso, and Heal Grass will restore HP when thrown at an ally.<br/>
Max HP won't increase when they're at full HP.
