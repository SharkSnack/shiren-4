# Overview

Bana Powers are special attacks and abilities used by Banana Prince.<br/>
They're learned by either getting hit by a thrown item, or getting hit by a monster's special attack.

Items that grant a Bana Power have a banana icon at the beginning of the item's description.<br/>â€» The banana icon is only displayed once you've entered Banana Kingdom at least one time.

<div class="relativeImage smallScreenshot">

</div>

Up to 8 Bana Powers can be learned at a time, with 4 being assigned to daytime, and 4 for nighttime.<br/>Banana Prince can use multiple Bana Powers in 1 turn if applicable, in order from top to bottom.

Bana Powers can be locked to avoid being overwritten when a new one is learned.<br/>
Locked Bana Powers are represented by a checkmark next to the number.
